# Repository Created Locally

This is a readme file created on my computer, not Github. I will eventually load this onto github using some commands. I'm learning. 

1) Start with "git init"
2) Create empty repository in github
3) Do "git remote add origin ___" and add you https link to the empty repository in the blank
4) To check type "get remote -v" in the command line
5) Finally do "git push --set-upstream origin main" and after that initial step you can do "get push" from then on out. it will push the updated files to the main branch of the repository.

## New Branch Changes

To add new branch follow these steps:

1) Check branches by doing "git branch" in command line
2) Add new branch by doing "git checkout -b "Name of branch" " in command line
3) Should automatically switch into that branch but if not then you can switch to a branch by typing in the command line "git checkout ____" with the branch name in the space.
